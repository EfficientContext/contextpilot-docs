# Video RAG: does reordering frames for cache reuse keep accuracy?

Setting: long-video question answering where each question retrieves a subset
of a video's frames. Reordering those frames so that frames shared with earlier
questions form a common prefix raises the engine's prefix-cache hit rate, but
it also destroys the chronological order the model would normally rely on. The
usual remedy is to state the true order in one sentence *after* the frames,
where it does not break the shared prefix.

This page reports what that costs and what it buys, measured end to end.

**Reproduce**: `examples/video_rag/` (frame extraction, retrieval, benchmark
runner, analysis). These are raw runs, not tuned.

## Setup

| | |
|---|---|
| Benchmarks | Video-MME (3 questions per video) and LVBench (hour-long videos, ~11 questions per video) |
| Retrieval | SigLIP-2 base over a 1 fps frame pool (≤256 frames/video, 448 px), top-16 frames per question |
| Models | Qwen3.8-27B (2×H100, tp 2), Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8 180B (4×H100, tp 4 ep 4) |
| Engine | SGLang v0.5.20, stock image, `--enable-cache-report` |
| Prompt | system + intro + frames + question, answer forced with "The best answer is:" |
| Requests | concurrency 4, engine cache flushed before every condition |

Conditions differ only in frame order and in how the true order is conveyed:

| condition | frame order | order information |
|---|---|---|
| `chrono_plain` | chronological | none (baseline) |
| `chrono_labels` | chronological | per-frame `[Frame i \| t=..s]` labels |
| `cp_sentence` | per-request ContextPilot reorder | one sentence listing the true order |
| `canon_*` | canonical per-video core prefix | per the suffix |

## Result 1 — reordering frames does not cost accuracy

**LVBench, Qwen3.8-27B, 1131 questions.** Paired against the chronological
baseline on the same questions (McNemar exact test on discordant pairs):

| condition | accuracy | Δ | p | cached tokens | uncached tokens/req |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `canon_none` (reorder, no order info) | 0.4403 | +0.002 | 0.91 | **8.0 %** | **1804** |
| `chrono_plain` (baseline) | 0.4385 | — | — | 0.6 % | 1949 |
| `canon_labels` | 0.4332 | −0.005 | 0.70 | 7.7 % | 2048 |
| `canon_sentence` | 0.4324 | −0.006 | 0.57 | 7.0 % | 2077 |
| `cp_sentence` (per-request reorder) | 0.4253 | −0.013 | 0.22 | 0.4 % | 2236 |

The canonical reordering matches the baseline accuracy exactly while raising the
cached-token share from 0.6 % to 8.0 % and cutting prefill tokens by 7.4 %.

**Video-MME, Qwen3.8-27B, 633 questions**, baseline 0.6872:

| condition | accuracy | Δ | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| `canon_none` | 0.6888 | +0.002 | 1.00 |
| `canon_sentence` | 0.6777 | −0.010 | 0.54 |
| `cp_sentence` | 0.6746 | −0.013 | 0.38 |
| `canon_labels` | 0.6746 | −0.013 | 0.43 |
| `chrono_labels` | 0.6619 | −0.025 | 0.044 |
| `canon_both` (labels + sentence) | 0.6351 | −0.052 | 0.001 |

**Video-MME, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8 180B, 708 questions**, baseline 0.7542:

| condition | accuracy | Δ | p |
|---|---|---|---|
| `canon_none` | 0.7500 | −0.004 | 0.78 |
| `canon_labels` | 0.7486 | −0.006 | 0.73 |
| `canon_both` | 0.7472 | −0.007 | 0.64 |
| `canon_sentence` | 0.7444 | −0.010 | 0.48 |
| `chrono_labels` | 0.7429 | −0.011 | 0.40 |
| `cp_sentence` | 0.7260 | −0.028 | 0.029 |

Across both benchmarks and both models, reordering the frames is free, and one
sentence stating the true order is free within noise. Two caveats show up in the
grid. On the 27B, supplying two order signals at once (labels *and* the
sentence) loses 5 points (p = 0.001), while the 180B absorbs both. And
per-request reordering — the variant that also fails to produce cache hits —
is the weakest arm on both models, significantly so on the 180B (p = 0.029).
Prefer the canonical prefix with a single order signal.

Note on model size: the same experiment on a 4B model showed the order sentence
costing 9–11 points (p < 1e−4) while reordering alone stayed free. Following a
positional order statement is what scales with model size, not tolerance for
reordering.

## Result 2 — the cache hit needs a canonical prefix

Leading frames shared between two questions on the same video (they share ~4 of
their 16 retrieved frames):

| ordering | mean shared leading frames | pairs sharing none |
|---|---|---|
| chronological | 0.26 | 89 % |
| ContextPilot reorder | 3.04 | 30 % |
| canonical core prefix | 8.89 | 0 % |

Hybrid linear-attention models (Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.8 / GLM-5.3-Flash) restore
their recurrent state only at recorded checkpoints, so a prefix boundary that
occurs once is never reused. Measured on one such server: a shared boundary
misses on its first two occurrences and is reused from the third on, which is
why per-request reordering yields nothing and a canonical prefix is required.

The payoff scales with how many questions share a video. On LVBench (~11
questions per video) the canonical prefix reached 8.0 % cached tokens against
0.6 % for the chronological baseline. On Video-MME (3 questions per video) the
same mechanism reached 10.8 % on a single-GPU server but under 1 % on the
multi-GPU servers used for the models above, so treat the canonical prefix as
necessary but not sufficient — the engine's checkpoint policy decides how much
of it is actually reused.

## Result 3 — what frame overlap is actually worth

Measured on a quiet server (Qwen3.8-27B, 2×H100, 36 CPUs requested), five
trials per cell, frames never previously sent so nothing is pre-encoded:

| | 64 frames (7.3k tok) | 128 frames (14.6k tok) |
|---|---|---|
| cold: new frames, empty KV | 4.01 s | 8.65 s |
| identical request, KV warm | 3.55 s (**−12 %**) | 7.07 s (**−18 %**) |
| same frames, new question, KV flushed | 4.09 s (−2 %) | — |

Two separate effects, often conflated:

* **KV prefix reuse is real and grows with context**: 12 % at 64 frames, 18 %
  at 128. This is the effect ContextPilot's reordering exists to enable, since
  a shared prefix is what makes the hit possible at all.
* **Re-sending the same images buys almost nothing (2 %)**: the vision encoder
  runs again on every request. There is no cross-request embedding reuse in a
  monolithic server, so overlap only pays through the KV cache.

The ceiling is set by the vision stage, which is CPU-bound on the serving pod
and accounts for the bulk of an image request:

| CPUs requested by the pod | cost per frame |
|---|---|
| 8 | 210 ms |
| 24 | 80 ms |
| 36 | 60–70 ms |

Provision CPU for the SGLang pod first: it moves the total far more than prompt
ordering does. Earlier revisions of this page reported first a flat "no
speedup" and then a "22–37 % speedup"; both were measured under CPU starvation
or on a contended server, and the table above supersedes them.

Realised versus available: the canonical prefix reached 8 % cached tokens on
LVBench at 16 frames but under 1 % at 64 frames with only 2 questions per
video, because a prefix boundary has to recur before this engine reuses it. The
12–18 % is an upper bound you approach as boundaries repeat, not a number you
get for free.

## Result 4 — frame count matters far more than frame order

Same benchmark and model, varying only how many retrieved frames are shown:

| frames per question | LVBench accuracy |
|---|---|
| 16 | 0.4385 (n=1131) |
| 64 | 0.6019 (n=206) |

Sixteen points, against at most a couple of points from any ordering condition.
For video RAG the ordering question is a second-order effect next to the frame
budget.

## Honest limitations

- Retrieval is a single dual-encoder over uniformly sampled frames; a stronger
  retriever changes the frame overlap between questions and so the headroom.
- 16 frames is sparse coverage for LVBench's hour-long videos, which is why its
  absolute accuracy is low; the comparison between conditions is unaffected
  because every condition sees the same frames.
- The cache and latency figures are tied to the SGLang version and flags listed
  above, and the cached-token share varied by server configuration.
- Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-FP8 ran on 4×H100 rather than H200: the cluster's H200
  nodes were fully booked by other tenants for the whole session.
- Accuracy results at 64 frames come from a 206-question subset covering all
  103 LVBench videos (2 questions per video); the 16-frame results use the full
  sets. GLM-5.3-Flash was never served: it needs 4×H200 or 8×H100 and neither
  was free.
