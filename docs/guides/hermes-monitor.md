# ContextPilot Hermes Monitor

This is an opt-in, metadata-only monitor for testing ContextPilot inside Hermes Agent over a one-week window.

## What it reads

- `~/.hermes/state.db:sessions` metadata only: token counts, tool/API call counts, source, estimated cost, timestamps.
- `~/.hermes/contextpilot/telemetry.jsonl` metadata-only ContextPilot savings records (preferred source).
- `~/.hermes/logs/gateway.log` lines containing ContextPilot savings summaries (fallback source).

It intentionally does **not** read:

- `messages.content`
- `sessions.system_prompt`
- reasoning fields
- raw tool call payloads
- raw user/assistant text

Session ids are salted SHA-256 hashes in reports.

## Daily run

```bash
python scripts/hermes_contextpilot_monitor.py \
  --out-dir ~/contextpilot/reports \
  --since-hours 24 \
  --telemetry-file ~/.hermes/contextpilot/telemetry.jsonl
```

The telemetry file is written by the ContextPilot Hermes plugin when savings occur. Set `CONTEXTPILOT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` to disable writes, or `CONTEXTPILOT_TELEMETRY_FILE=/path/to/file.jsonl` to override the location.

Outputs:

- `~/contextpilot/reports/daily_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `~/contextpilot/reports/daily_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Suggested Hermes cron job

Use this as a read-only watchdog. It produces reports; it does not apply config/code changes.

```python
cronjob(
    action="create",
    name="contextpilot-hermes-monitor-7d",
    schedule="0 4 * * *",
    repeat=7,
    deliver="origin",
    enabled_toolsets=["terminal", "file"],
    prompt="""
Run /root/work/ContextPilot/scripts/hermes_contextpilot_monitor.py with --out-dir /root/contextpilot/reports --since-hours 24.
Then read the generated Markdown report for today and send a short Chinese summary: token savings, session count, whether ContextPilot log events were observed, and any blocker. Do not read raw conversation content. Do not modify source/config.
""",
)
```

## Quick savings summary (lightweight)

If you just want a lightweight realized-savings summary, use the
`scripts/contextpilot_savings.py` command instead of this monitor or the analyzer
below. It reads **only** the metadata-only telemetry file, imports no Hermes
internals, and prints a one-screen summary. Character savings are measured from
ContextPilot's actual before/after processed payload; exact tokenizer tokens are
shown only when telemetry recorded an explicitly configured exact tokenizer
backend. The legacy chars/4 counter is labelled as derived; tokenizer measurement
is off by default to avoid provider/tokenizer mismatches.

```bash
python scripts/contextpilot_savings.py            # last 24h
python scripts/contextpilot_savings.py --all-time # everything
python scripts/contextpilot_savings.py --format json
# or, after Hermes plugin install:
python ~/.hermes/plugins/ContextPilot/scripts/contextpilot_savings.py
```

It reports events, processed-payload chars saved, exact tokenizer tokens when
available, and the legacy derived chars/4 counter. This is the right tool for
ordinary users; the monitor in this guide (which also reads `state.db` metadata)
and the content-aware analyzer below are for deeper investigation.

### Ask Hermes for savings

To let users get this summary without typing the command, the repo ships a
narrow, read-only Hermes skill at `skills/contextpilot-savings/SKILL.md`. Copy
or install it into your Hermes skills, then ask Hermes something like "show
ContextPilot token savings" or "how much did ContextPilot save all time?".
Hermes locates `scripts/contextpilot_savings.py` (in the repo/plugin checkout or
at `~/.hermes/plugins/ContextPilot/scripts/contextpilot_savings.py`), runs it
with the right `--since-hours` / `--all-time` / `--format json` options, and
summarizes the output. The skill is observe-only — it reads only the
metadata-only telemetry through this script and makes no code, config, or
scheduling changes.

## Opportunity scanning

`scripts/analyze_hermes_context_opportunities.py` is a companion scanner meant
for a continuous cron job. Where the monitor stays metadata-only, this analyzer
*does* read message content and tool outputs — but only in-memory, to compute
salted SHA-256 fingerprints and aggregate counters. Reports never contain raw
message/tool text, system prompts, reasoning, or raw session ids.

It surfaces concrete token-reduction opportunities:

- exact duplicate tool outputs (identical payloads re-sent across turns),
- repeated line/block fingerprints (shared boilerplate across outputs),
- large tool outputs grouped by `tool_name`,
- heavy sessions by input-token / tool-call / message counts (hashed ids),
- **Prompt duplicate shadow telemetry** for exact system/skill prompt template
  repeats (advisory only; no prompt rewriting),
- ContextPilot telemetry coverage and processed-payload savings counters,
- **Worker Context Routing shadow labels** for future router training/eval,
- **Parent Aggregation Artifact telemetry** (exact duplicate worker/parent
  artifacts grouped by hash) for future parent-aggregation dedup eval.

### LLM-bound block redundancy

The analyzer also performs an **LLM-bound block scan** that looks *only* at
content Hermes would actually send to a model, and reports where the same block
is paid for more than once:

- `sessions.system_prompt`, classified heuristically as `system_prompt` or
  `skill_prompt` (skill frontmatter / "use this skill" style cues),
- active `messages.content` for roles `system` / `user` / `assistant` / `tool`,
  bucketed as `user_prompt`, `assistant_context`, `tool_result`, etc.,
- tool-result messages (`role='tool'` or `tool_name` set) as `tool_result`.

Inactive messages are skipped when an `active` column exists, and archived
sessions (and their messages) are skipped when an `archived` column exists. Each
block is split line-wise, fingerprinted with a salted SHA-256 hash, and
aggregated. The report then shows:

- **redundancy by block type** — per-type block / unique / repeated counts and
  estimated redundant tokens,
- **cross-type repeated blocks** — the headline signal: a single fingerprint
  observed in 2+ block types (e.g. the same chunk shipped from a skill/system
  prompt *and* a tool result *and* a user prompt). Reported only as a hash plus
  per-type counters — never the raw text.

### Prompt duplicate shadow mode

The analyzer includes a dedicated **Prompt duplicate blocks — system/skill**
section for the static-template opportunity found in Hermes workloads. It scans
only `system_prompt` and `skill_prompt` blocks, groups **EXACT** duplicate block
fingerprints, and reports:

- duplicate group count and duplicate occurrence count,
- actual duplicated characters observed in prompt assembly,
- a derived chars/4 advisory token counter labelled as advisory,
- per-type counters and top salted hashes.

This section is **advisory only**. It never rewrites, summarizes, deduplicates,
or replaces prompt text, and its counters are not realized savings. Use it to
prioritize a future prompt-assembly A/B where before/after payloads are measured
with an exact tokenizer/API usage comparison.

### Prompt dedup A/B simulation

The analyzer also includes a **Prompt dedup A/B simulation — system/skill**
section. This is the evidence gate before any canary replacement. It still does
not mutate runtime payloads: it keeps prompt text in memory, groups exact
duplicate `system_prompt` / `skill_prompt` blocks, and simulates the accounting
for keeping the first occurrence while replacing only later occurrences with a
deterministic reference placeholder.

The simulation reports candidate classes separately:

- `same_type_skill_prompt_only` — lowest-risk first canary candidate,
- `same_type_system_prompt_only` — higher risk,
- `cross_type_system_skill` — higher risk because it crosses prompt hierarchy.

For each class the report includes group counts, replacement occurrence counts,
`chars_before`, `chars_after_simulated`, and signed `chars_delta_simulated`.
When you pass an explicitly configured tokenizer backend, for example
`--prompt-dedup-tokenizer tiktoken:cl100k_base`, it also reports actual tokenizer
before/after/delta fields for the simulation. Without that opt-in backend,
`tokenizer_status=unavailable` and no fake actual-token numbers are emitted.

Use `--disable-prompt-dedup-ab` to omit this section. Even when enabled, all
figures are **simulation-only**, **not realized savings**, and no prompt text is
rewritten, summarized, deduplicated, or emitted.

### Prompt dedup canary (runtime; default OFF)

> **Use only after the A/B simulation above shows a clear, positive
> `same_type_skill_prompt_only` delta and you have a golden eval in place.**
> This is the one ContextPilot path that *actually rewrites prompt text*; treat
> it as gray/canary, not default behavior.

Everything else in the analyzer is measurement/shadow/simulation only. The
canary (`contextpilot.hermes_opportunities.prompt_dedup_canary`) is the single
runtime replacement path and it is **off by default**. It is controlled entirely
by environment variables — no config file is required:

```sh
# off (default): no scan, no mutation, no prompt-dedup savings recorded
CONTEXTPILOT_PROMPT_DEDUP_MODE=off

# shadow: measure what a canary *would* replace; payload still unchanged
CONTEXTPILOT_PROMPT_DEDUP_MODE=shadow

# canary: actually replace later exact duplicate skill-prompt blocks
CONTEXTPILOT_PROMPT_DEDUP_MODE=canary
```

**Rollback / kill switch.** Set the mode back to `off` (or unset the variable)
to disable immediately. The escape-hatch variable forces `off` regardless of the
mode variable, for an instant kill without editing the mode:

```sh
CONTEXTPILOT_PROMPT_DEDUP_DISABLE=1   # forces off even if MODE=canary
```

What the canary will and will not do, even when `MODE=canary`:

- It acts **only** on the `same_type_skill_prompt_only` class — an EXACT
  duplicate block whose every occurrence is inside `skill_prompt` content.
- It **never** replaces `system_prompt`-only duplicates, **never** replaces
  cross-type `system_prompt`/`skill_prompt` duplicates, and **never** touches
  user, assistant, tool, or ordinary system-prompt content.
- The **first** occurrence is always kept verbatim; only later exact duplicates
  are replaced, and only with a deterministic reference string containing a
  low-cardinality prompt-type enum plus a salted hash — never raw prompt text.
- A replacement happens only when the reference string is **strictly shorter**
  than the line it replaces, so the payload is never grown.
- A broad **safety denylist** (instruction / safety / security / tool / auth /
  secret / must / never / always / required / ...) leaves any matching block
  unchanged even in canary mode. Skill-prompt detection is conservative: if a
  block is not clearly a skill-prompt duplicate, it is left as-is.

Telemetry is metadata-only: `prompt_dedup_mode`, `prompt_dedup_class`,
`prompt_dedup_blocks_replaced`, and `prompt_dedup_chars_saved` (mode/class enums
and integer counters only — no prompt text). The realized `prompt_dedup_chars_saved`
and its contribution to the aggregate `chars_saved` total are non-zero **only
when a real canary mutation occurred**; `off` and `shadow` record no prompt-dedup
savings.

### Worker Context Routing shadow mode

The analyzer now includes a **Worker Context Routing — shadow mode** section by
default. This is P0 data collection only: it never drops, summarizes, or mutates
context. It fingerprints each LLM-bound block and emits only low-cardinality
labels/counters such as:

- `policy_must_keep` for user/system/skill prompts and explicit safety /
  acceptance constraints,
- `direct_task_hint` for short actionable task/error hints,
- `likely_relevant` for conservative default-keep blocks,
- `summarizable_candidate` / `likely_drop_candidate` for large or repeated
  tool-like blocks that a future router might route away. Large diagnostic logs
  containing `error:` / `failed` / `traceback` cues are still only advisory
  summarization candidates, not must-drop decisions.

The report includes estimated advisory candidate tokens and salted candidate
block hashes. These are **not realized savings** and must be treated as training
/ evaluation data for a future high-recall router. Use
`--disable-worker-routing-shadow` only when you want to omit this section from a
scan.

### Parent Aggregation Artifacts — shadow mode

The analyzer also includes a **Parent Aggregation Artifacts — shadow mode**
section by default. This is **P0 telemetry only**: it collects data so a future
parent-aggregation dedup can be evaluated offline. It never drops, summarizes,
replaces, or mutates any context.

When a parent/orchestrator aggregates results from several workers, the same
artifact body (a test log, a diff, a file dump, a review summary, ...) is often
carried into the parent's LLM context once per worker and again in the parent's
own roll-up — paying for the same tokens several times. The analyzer groups
**EXACT** artifact bodies by salted content hash (near-duplicates never group),
classifies each body with a deterministic heuristic kind, and emits only
low-cardinality metadata + counters:

- `artifact_kind` — one of `test_log`, `terminal_output`, `file_content`,
  `diff`, `error_trace`, `review_findings`, `benchmark_result`,
  `worker_summary`, `unknown_large_block` (deterministic, first-match-wins),
- per-kind summary — distinct bodies, occurrences, duplicate-group count,
  estimated tokens, and advisory duplicate tokens,
- **provenance** — per duplicate group, `source_type_counts` such as
  `tool_result xN` and `assistant_context xM`, plus a deterministically chosen
  `canonical_source_type` (the dominant origin, tie-broken alphabetically),
- top duplicate artifact groups, reported **only** as a salted `content_hash`
  plus counters.

`est_duplicate_tokens` is computed as `(occurrences - 1) * est_tokens` and is an
**advisory upper bound** on what a future parent dedup might save — **not a
realized saving**, and payloads are never changed. No raw artifact / worker /
tool / system text, and no raw session ids, are ever emitted. Only sizeable
blocks (`>= --min-artifact-chars`, default 400) from parent/worker output origins
(`assistant_context` and `tool_result`) are considered candidates, so prompt
boilerplate and short hints never enter this telemetry. Use
`--disable-parent-aggregation` to omit this section from a scan.

Use `--all-sessions` to ignore the `--since-hours` window and scan **all**
non-archived sessions and active messages (useful for a one-shot, whole-history
audit rather than a rolling daily window):

```bash
# rolling daily window
python scripts/analyze_hermes_context_opportunities.py \
  --state-db /root/.hermes/state.db \
  --telemetry-file ~/.hermes/contextpilot/telemetry.jsonl \
  --out-dir ~/contextpilot/opportunities \
  --since-hours 24

# whole-history audit across every session and LLM-bound block
python scripts/analyze_hermes_context_opportunities.py \
  --state-db /root/.hermes/state.db \
  --telemetry-file ~/.hermes/contextpilot/telemetry.jsonl \
  --out-dir ~/contextpilot/opportunities \
  --all-sessions
```

Outputs:

- `~/contextpilot/opportunities/opportunities_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `~/contextpilot/opportunities/opportunities_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Each estimated "wasted tokens" figure is a heuristic (chars / 4); treat the
report as a prioritized list of candidates and validate against the accuracy
gate below before changing ContextPilot config or code. A defensive guard in
`write_report` refuses to emit any forbidden raw-content key, so the reports are
safe to ship from an unattended cron job.

## Default-off canaries

Prompt and artifact reuse are opt-in canaries. Ordinary installs keep both off
unless an operator explicitly enables them and restarts Hermes.

```bash
# Skill-prompt exact duplicate canary (lowest-risk prompt class)
export CONTEXTPILOT_PROMPT_DEDUP_MODE=canary

# Provenance-aware tool/artifact exact duplicate canary
export CONTEXTPILOT_ARTIFACT_DEDUP_MODE=canary

# Emergency kill switches
export CONTEXTPILOT_PROMPT_DEDUP_DISABLE=1
export CONTEXTPILOT_ARTIFACT_DEDUP_DISABLE=1
```

The artifact canary only keeps the first full `tool_result`/`assistant_context`
artifact body and replaces later exact duplicates with a shorter ContextPilot
reference. It does not summarize, semantically compress, or drop user/system
content.

## Safety gates

This monitor reports processed-payload savings, exact tokenizer token deltas when recorded, and operational signals. Before shipping ContextPilot changes, run a fixed golden eval set and require:

- no task-success regression,
- no drop in context recall beyond the chosen threshold,
- no unsafe raw-content leakage in reports,
- no increase in failed tool calls.

If any gate fails, hold proposals and require human review.
